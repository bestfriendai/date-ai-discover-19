# Product Requirements Document

The codebase has several potential issues that need to be addressed:

1. API Key Management and Validation
- Issue: Hardcoded API keys and insufficient validation in search-events function
- Impact: Security risks and potential service disruptions
- Requirements: Remove hardcoded keys, implement proper validation, return clear errors

2. PredictHQ Location Parameter Handling
- Issue: Complex and potentially buggy location parameter processing
- Impact: Inconsistent search results and location handling
- Requirements: Simplify parameter prioritization, improve coordinate validation

3. PredictHQ API Response Normalization
- Issue: Fragile event normalization with insufficient error handling
- Impact: Potential crashes and data inconsistencies
- Requirements: Implement robust error handling, improve location/venue string building

4. Missing Coordinates Fallback
- Issue: Inconsistent handling of events missing coordinates
- Impact: Events may not appear on map or appear in wrong locations
- Requirements: Ensure all events have valid coordinates with proper fallback logic

5. Mapbox Marker Management
- Issue: Complex marker lifecycle management with React Portals
- Impact: Potential memory leaks and performance issues
- Requirements: Refine marker lifecycle handling, improve cleanup

6. Mapbox Events and State Synchronization
- Issue: Potential state sync issues between Mapbox and React
- Impact: UI inconsistencies and interaction bugs
- Requirements: Improve event handling and state management

7. Itinerary Item Editing
- Issue: Inconsistent state management in EditItinerary component
- Impact: Potential data loss and UI glitches
- Requirements: Simplify state management, improve data flow

Each issue requires careful implementation considering:
- TypeScript type safety
- React best practices
- Performance optimization
- Error handling
- Testing strategy
- Documentation updates
